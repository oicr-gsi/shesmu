# Vidarr Plugin
[Vidarr](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/vidarr) is a bioinformatics analysis
provenance system.

To integrate Shesmu with a Vidarr server, create a configuration file ending in
`.vidarr` as follows:

    {
      "defaultMaxSubmissionDelay": null,
      "url": "http://vidarr:8000"
    }

This will populate Shesmu with target + workflow combinations from the Vidarr
server. They will be updated every 10 minutes.

The `"defaultMaxSubmissionDelay"` determines if actions that might be stale
should be submitted to Vidarr. If null, workflow runs will always be submitted.
If a number, in seconds, is given, then the action must have been
(re-)generated by an olive in that window to be submitted to Vidarr. If that
window is exceeded, they will be run as dry-run.

The Vidarr plugin provides an input format: `vidarr_analysis` which provides the analysis
provenance data. To use this input format add the fields to the configuration file as follows:

      "analysisTypes": ["FILE"],
      "versionTypes": []

The `"analysisTypes"` specifies the type of analysis desired. If no analysisTypes are specified the 
input format will be empty. For expected values reference
the [Vidarr AnalysisOutputType class](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/vidarr/blob/master/vidarr-pluginapi/src/main/java/ca/on/oicr/gsi/vidarr/api/AnalysisOutputType.java).

The `"versionTypes"` specifies
the [version keys](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/vidarr/blob/master/architecture.md#external-identifier-versions)
that should be returned; if empty,
all version keys are allowed.
