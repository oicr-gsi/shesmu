# JIRA
[JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is an issue and project tracking
application.
The JIRA plugin for Shesmu can be used to launch additional actions (opening and
closing JIRA tickets). The
[launch-actions.md](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/shesmu/blob/master/launch-actions.md) file
contains instructions for setting up JIRA integration.
